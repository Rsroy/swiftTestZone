 Reverse a string
 Come up with a function that takes an input string and reverses its order. For example, "I love Codecademy!" should return "!ymedacedoC evol I."

 For an added challenge, switch capitalization so that each new word is capitalized. So, "I love Codecademy" outputs as "Ymedacedoc Evol I."
